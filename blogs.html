    <h2><div class= "nav-fix">The Industry<span class="dot3">.</span></div></h2>
    <p>In the Manchester digital skills audit for 2019 it was noticed that the gender split within tech roles actually failed to include the non-binary. Such an issue I can contribute towards a change in by further helping to aid diversity and accessibility within the industry. In the A List Apart’s article on transgender inclusive design (<a class = "link" href="https://alistapart.com/article/trans-inclusive-design/">White, 2019</a>). We see that transgender inclusivity is a rising matter and as such needs to be addressed to better include those who don’t fit into the gender binary. I also feel that I could personally better educate the industry in such matter as a member of the transgender community.</p> 

    <p>To quote the skills audit ‘much work has been done in the industry to remove the stigma around mental health’ (<a class = "link" href="https://moodle.mmu.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3749746/mod_resource/content/1/Manchester-Digital-Skills-Audit-2019.pdf">Manchester Digital, 2019</a>) something which is vital due to my need to be transparent with an employer about mental health issues and the barriers this creates. It’s also a refreshing fact to read that public awareness of neurodiversity is rising ‘a huge, untapped source of talent out there most employers are missing out on ’(<a class = "link" href="https://diginomica.com/thinking-differently-benefits-neurodiversity">Milne, 2018</a>) the industry demonstrating this level of acceptance and awareness helps to eradicate stigma significantly reducing the barriers of entry to work.</p>

<p>The areas of development and user experience have respectively grown 40% and 22% (<a class = "link" href="https://moodle.mmu.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3749746/mod_resource/content/1/Manchester-Digital-Skills-Audit-2019.pdf">Manchester Digital, 2019</a>) these statistics give me relative confidence that upon graduation I should be able to find employment within one of these fields, this said I also noted that developer was the hardest position to fill which will be my primary focus when looking for jobs. The skills audit stipulated the most in demand programming languages are as follows </p>
<ol>
<li>php</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>java</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>html</li>
</ol>
<p>While my knowledge of html and CSS is relatively competent through my time at MMU we have touched on php and JavaScript giving me a fundamental understanding of the languages, I plan to build on this alongside learning java and C#, so I am fully equipped when applying for position within the industry. To this end there is a wealth of resources at my disposal such an example being LinkedIn Learning alongside the myriad of meetups and conferences located locally in Manchester, also serving as an excellent networking opportunity.</p>

<p>When looking at the growth we see from the digital skills audit, Whereby we see 54% of companies reporting growth (<a class = "link" href="https://moodle.mmu.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3749746/mod_resource/content/1/Manchester-Digital-Skills-Audit-2019.pdf">Manchester Digital, 2019</a>) and when we compare this to the tech nation report we do see that the UK is fourth in terms of total scaleup investment (<a class = "link" href="https://technation.io/report2019/#introduction">Tech Nation, 2019</a>) which is an indicator of positive interest in the industry and serves as evidence to continual investment. These factors indicate that employment opportunities should increase or at the very least there should be appropriate jobs available upon graduation should growth and investment stay consistent. In an article by Lisa Jewell we also see that ‘Demand for UX professionals has never been greater’ (<a class = "link" href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/want-a-career-in-ux/">Jewell, 2019</a>) due to bigger companies expanding design teams upon realising that a larger design team amongst other things often leads to a more researched and refined product. Such statistics to make the field incredibly alluring and alongside my aforementioned diversity I feel that it would be easy to contribute in making the web generally more accessible. This coupled with my experience in professional design work would make me a useful asset to a UX team.</p>

<p>In summary we can see that in looking for work as a front end developer there is a large skills gap between graduate and employee this in mind I am aware of the coding languages I need to become fluent in and plan on improving my communication skills alongside this I also plan to build on my design skills ensuring that I am well versed in modern design and UX tools to allow me to be versatile within the industry.</p>

    <h2><div class= "nav-fix">Building<span class="dot3">.</span></div></h2>
    <p>When beginning to work on my portfolio, my first step was to look at existing websites by other industry professionals this led me to Onno Schwanen (<a class = "link" href="https://onnoschwanen.com/">Schwanen, 2013</a>) whose site was remarkably simplistic in its layout and content delivery but also distinctly effective in its design. Keeping its text blocking effective while not compromising on content. The website also colour blocks its sections making a very professional looking layout.</p>

    <p>One of the other key influences on my site design was Sara Soueidan whose also effectively laid out and grouped content making the site easily readable. Her site also had a distinctive way of laying out her past employers utilizing logos to effectively give the reader an easy point of association.</p>
    
    <p>Taking both of these inspirations into account I decided I would like to block content with decent spacing between blocks of text to make it easily readable. I also noted while looking at a myriad of other portfolio pieces I would want to do something to make my design stand out. In acknowledging this I chose to opt for minimal page usage in a bid to keep the user from having to move between pages and perhaps retaining user attention. After discussing this with tutors I decided I would like to make my portfolio a single long page of content rather than many small pages in order to make it slightly more distinctive. I found that this was possible to do this, but I would only need to make external pages for the relevant blog posts to help reduce text blocking.</p>
    
    <p>Before moving onto the building stage on my website, I started by creating a rough style sheet to help decide colour and typography while further helping me decide on visual styling for the website. Following this a high-fidelity wireframe was created with the aim that it would help me effectively visualize the sites design and how I would approach the building phase.</p>
    
    <p>Starting the design phase I initially utilised CSS Grid to create a functional template for the site and adding placeholder content to give me an idea of what I was capable of and what I would need to attempt to learn. unfortunately, due to personal issues my work on the project slowed. When continuing to build I attempted to build the site using entirely flex instead of grid for its adaptability for mobile and attempting to reduce build time and later found it would be more effective to mix both methods as for example flex was massively effective when implementing the site navigation.</p>
    
    <p>Once the structure of the site was effectively in place I moved on writing content to replace placeholders and implementing the logos for my skills sections this then moved onto enhancing certain styling elements for example having the navigation item underline when interacted with and then a further CSS smoothing to improve the scrolling caused by the nav buttons moving to specific sections.</p>
    
    <p>Regrettably I did leave the mobile optimisation as the last thing to build which caused some design and layout issues do to not giving myself an appropriate amount of time to work on it. Utilising media query the site was made into a mobile format that is still functional. Had managed my time more effectively I would have sought to further refine this mobile design, perhaps add some more detailed CSS styling.</p>

    <h2>Performance and Optimisation<span class="dot3">.</span></h2>
    <h5>Code</h5>
<p>When coding the portfolio I attempted to keep the semantics as clean as possible using proper tags and semantics and attempting to reduce the amount of divs where possible and re-using classes whenever possible.</p>

<h3>Optimisation<span class="dot">.</span></h3>
<p>When running the website through google page speed (<a class = "link" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google, 2019</a>) my site managed a desktop speed of 100 and a mobile speed of 99 something which I am pleased with.</p>

<section id="feedback">
    <h2><h2><div class= "nav-fix">Feedback<span class="dot">.</span></div></h2>
    <p>When looking into the feedback received on my first version of my portfolio site, I was able to extrapolate a list of changes that could be implemented to improve the site build and performance to make it more strongly adhere to a professional standard. Having this opportunity to reflect also allowed me to add my own changes that I felt would enhance the design and performance.</p>
    <p>Starting the update, I began with the blogs page as it was largely unstyled, missing fonts and generally unfinished. To begin I implemented the same nav bar as the home page also adding some section ID’s to the body to allow for some quick on page navigation, this all helped to bring the blogs sub-page to the same standard as the home. I then implemented the link so the google fonts would apply mimicking the homepage and properly linking references so they’re clickable, this did create a slight issue as I had previously changed my a tags so they would be white against the nav menu, the solution was to  make a new a class for alternative links with a sperate colour rule of blue similar to that of Microsoft word for familiarity. </p>
    <p>The title spacing on all pages was adjusted by adding specific margins and manually adjusting the spacing. Utilising a series of guides, I refamiliarized myself with flexbox and was then able to tweak the layout to reduce overall page length allowing me to display things like for example the skills and experience sections more effectively by utilising a column like layout.</p>
    <p>Using the w3school conversion tool (<a class = "link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_pxtoemconversion.asp">w3schools, no date</a>) I converted my px measurements to a mixture of em and rem as I learned why px is outdated and causes accessibility issues (<a class = "link" href="https://engageinteractive.co.uk/blog/em-vs-rem-vs-px">Willians, 2017</a>) and rem is better for spacing/sizing while em is more effective for media queries. The result of this processes left a few outliers who hadn’t converted very well, so I continued by making some manual tweaks and refreshing the page locally while also tweaking the width, so the sections aligned with the nav bar. </p>
    <p>I solved a small labelling error that was causing the contact section to appear not fully formatted once the id was written properly the spacing and fonts appeared as intended. Another error was the blog pages navigation bar would cover up the sections titles this was solved by adding an additional class for the relevent titles.Stops were added after the titles for all section headings to make the overall design feel more consistent and the block prior to the title was removed. I added in some relevant metadata after looking up a relevant guide detailing how to properly write metadata and its importance (<a class = "link" href="https://www.kanukadigital.com/2019/04/guide-to-writing-metadata/">Bowers, no date</a>). The footer from the homepage was applied to the blogs sub-page and contact links to Twitter and GitHub were added also the about me titleing was changed to who? . Lastly everything was spellchecked thoroughly, and some segments re-written in order to flow better.</p>

    <p>Upon feedback from the portfolio show I began to further enhance the site my first step being to add a soft scroll 509  </p>
